# Jobs to be Done - Authentication & Onboarding

## What is Jobs to be Done (JTBD)?

Jobs to be Done is a framework for understanding user motivations and desired outcomes. Rather than focusing on demographics or features, JTBD asks: "What job is the user trying to accomplish, and what are the circumstances that cause them to need it?"

A well-written JTBD statement follows this format:
> "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

## JTBD Success Metrics

For each job, we measure success by:

1. **Time to Completion:** How quickly can the user complete the job?
2. **Task Success Rate:** What percentage of users successfully complete the job?
3. **Satisfaction Score:** How satisfied are users with the experience?
4. **Abandonment Rate:** What percentage of users give up before completing the job?
5. **Error Rate:** How often do users encounter errors or obstacles?

## Key Insights from JTBD Analysis

### 1. Context Preservation is Critical
Users are trying to accomplish specific goals (get updates, apply to opportunity, accept collaboration). Any loss of context derails their job and causes frustration.

### 2. Speed Matters
All jobs have urgency or time sensitivity. Every extra step or delay works against the job completion.

### 3. Clarity Reduces Anxiety
Users need to understand what they're signing up for, what access they'll get, and what happens next. Ambiguity creates anxiety and abandonment.

### 4. User Types Have Different Jobs
Residents and stakeholders are trying to accomplish fundamentally different jobs, requiring different experiences.

### 5. Approval Waiting is a Job Interruption
For jobs requiring approval, the waiting state needs to set clear expectations and maintain engagement, otherwise users disengage permanently.

## Application to Feature Design

Based on these JTBD insights, the authentication redesign should:

1. **Minimize Steps:** Every extra step reduces job completion rate
2. **Preserve Context:** Never lose sight of what the user was trying to accomplish
3. **Set Clear Expectations:** Always explain what happens next and when
4. **Differentiate Experiences:** Tailor flows to the specific job being accomplished
5. **Reduce Anxiety:** Provide visibility, status updates, and clear outcomes
6. **Enable Speed:** Make happy paths fast and frictionless
7. **Support Recovery:** When things go wrong, provide clear paths to success
